Zero Division Error Handling
This program demonstarte the error handling in solidity programming language.

Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this program, we will show the error handling in solidity programming language. Error handling in Solidity involves techniques and constructs used to handle exceptional cases, validate inputs, and respond to errors or invalid conditions within smart contracts. We will show the error hadling using various statements like assert() , require() and revert(). We have taken ZeroDivision error as the problem in this program and handled it using error handling technique.

Getting Started
Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., errorHandling.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract ZeroDivisionErrorHandling{ 
    uint public result;
    function testRequire(uint numerator, uint denominator) public {
        // Using require() to handle zero division error
        require(denominator != 0, "Denominator must be non-zero.");

        // Performing division operation
        result = numerator / denominator;
    }

    function testAssert(uint numerator, uint denominator) public {
        // Using assert() to handle zero division error
        assert(denominator != 0);

        // Performing division operation
        result = numerator / denominator;
    }

    function testRevert(uint numerator, uint denominator) public {
        // Handling zero division error using revert()
        if (denominator == 0) {
            revert("Denominator must be non-zero.");
        }

        // Performing division operation
        result = numerator / denominator;
    }


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ErrorHandling" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
